      "## Getting Started\n",
      "\n",
      "This crate requires the C++ PyTorch library (libtorch) in version *v2.0.0* to be available on\n",
      "your system. You can either:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use the system-wide libtorch installation (default).\n",
      "- Install libtorch manually and let the build script know about it via the `LIBTORCH` environment variable.\n",
      "- Use a Python PyTorch install, to do this set `LIBTORCH_USE_PYTORCH=1`.\n",
      "- When a system-wide libtorch can't be found and `LIBTORCH` is not set, the\n",
      "  build script can download a pre-built binary version of libtorch by using\n",
      "  the `download-libtorch` feature. By default a CPU version is used. The\n",
      "  `TORCH_CUDA_VERSION` environment variable can be set to `cu117` in order to\n",
      "  get a pre-built binary using CUDA 11.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "### System-wide Libtorch\n",
      "\n",
      "On linux platforms, the build script will look for a system-wide libtorch\n",
      "library in `/usr/lib/libtorch.so`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Python PyTorch Install\n",
      "\n",
      "If the `LIBTORCH_USE_PYTORCH` environment variable is set, the active python\n",
      "interpreter is called to retrieve information about the torch python package.\n",
      "This version is then linked against.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Libtorch Manual Install\n",
      "\n",
      "- Get `libtorch` from the\n",
      "[PyTorch website download section](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and extract\n",
      "the content of the zip file.\n",
      "- For Linux users, add the following to your `.bashrc` or equivalent, where `/path/to/libtorch`\n",
      "is the path to the directory that was created when unzipping the file.\n",

      "    - Navigate to Control Panel -> View advanced system settings -> Environment variables.\n",
      "    - Create the `LIBTORCH` variable and set it to `X:\\path\\to\\libtorch`.\n",
      "    - Append `X:\\path\\to\\libtorch\\lib` to the `Path` variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If you prefer to temporarily set environment variables, in PowerShell you can run\n",

      "\n",
      "### Windows Specific Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "As per [the pytorch docs](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html) the Windows debug and release builds are not ABI-compatible. This could lead to some segfaults if the incorrect version of libtorch is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is recommended to use the MSVC Rust toolchain (e.g. by installing `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` via rustup) rather than a MinGW based one as PyTorch has compatibilities issues with MinGW.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Tensor Operations\n",
      "\n",
      "This crate provides a tensor type which wraps PyTorch tensors. Here is a minimal\n",
      "example of how to perform some tensor operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "```rust\n",
      "use tch::Tensor;\n",
      "\n",
      "fn main() {\n",

      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Training a Model via Gradient Descent\n",
      "\n",
      "PyTorch provides automatic differentiation for most tensor operations\n",
      "it supports. This is commonly used to train models using gradient\n",
      "descent. The optimization is performed over variables which are created\n",
      "via a `nn::VarStore` by defining their shapes and initializations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example below `my_module` uses two variables `x1` and `x2`\n",
      "which initial values are 0. The forward pass applied to tensor `xs`\n",
      "returns `xs * x1 + exp(xs) * x2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the model has been generated, a `nn::Sgd` optimizer is created.\n",
      "Then on each step of the training loop:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The forward pass is applied to a mini-batch of data.\n",
      "- A loss is computed as the mean square error between the model output and the mini-batch ground truth.\n",
      "- Finally an optimization step is performed: gradients are computed and variables from the `VarStore` are modified accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "```rust\n",
      "use tch::nn::{Module, OptimizerConfig};\n",
      "use tch::{kind, nn, Device, Tensor};\n",
      "\n",
      "fn my_module(p: nn::Path, dim: i64) -> impl nn::Module {\n",

      "    let my_module = my_module(vs.root(), 7);\n",
      "    let mut opt = nn::Sgd::default().build(&vs, 1e-2).unwrap();\n",
      "    for _idx in 1..50 {\n",

      "        let ys = Tensor::zeros(&[7], kind::FLOAT_CPU);\n",
      "        let loss = (my_module.forward(&xs) - ys).pow_tensor_scalar(2).sum(kind::Kind::Float);\n",
      "        opt.backward_step(&loss);\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Writing a Simple Neural Network\n",
      "\n",
      "The `nn` api can be used to create neural network architectures, e.g. the following code defines\n",
      "a simple model with one hidden layer and trains it on the MNIST dataset using the Adam optimizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "```rust\n",
      "use anyhow::Result;\n",
